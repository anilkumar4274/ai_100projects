This project is made using Python Opencv & Tensorflow.
This project is uploaded without dataset.
To get access to this project just download the project and download the dataset for Face Mask Detection from Kaggle.
Keep in mind to keep minimum of 2000 images each for with_mask & without_mask.
If you keep more images it will consume more time for training purpose.
After adding the dataset run the file train_mask_detector line by line and save the model for the training dataset.
Once the model and plot images are saved, Now move to mask_detect_video and run the code line by line.
New window will appear capturing live video form your PC's webcam.
Now try to remove mask and wear it in order to get the result.

Requirements( these should be installed in your PC):
- Tensorflow
- OpenCV
- Keras
- imutils
- numpy
- matplotlib
- sklearn


Additional Features will be upgraded soon...
