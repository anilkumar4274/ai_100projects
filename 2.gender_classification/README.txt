This project is made using Python, Opencv, sk-learn & Tensorflow.
This project is uploaded without dataset.
To get access to this project just download the project and download the dataset for Gender Detection from Kaggle.
Keep in mind to keep minimum of 2000 images each for man and women
If you keep more images it will consume more time for training purpose.
After adding the dataset run the file gender_train.ipynb line by line and save the model for the training dataset.
Once the model and plot images are saved, Now move to live_gender_detection.ipynb and run the code line by line.
New window will appear capturing live video form your PC's webcam.
Now try to test keeping man and women both in front of camera in order to get the result.

Requirements( these should be installed in your PC):
- Tensorflow
- OpenCV
- Keras
- imutils
- numpy
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- glob

Additional Features will be added soon...
